Description: This package intends to go above and beyond of the features
    provided by the testthat package. Namely, stubbing of functions and methods
    is provided as well as the ability to architect mock structured hierarchies
    of files (sometimes called fixtures).
    Intended for developers, testthatsomemore aims to
    raise the caliber of R testing frameworks to that of famous libraries
    like JUnit and RSpec.
